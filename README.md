# Shell_Scripting
A bash script for using powheg-v2 (A montecarlo eventgenerator) on lxplus! same idea can be used for any other MC event generator! you just need to chage the veriable according to your lxplus environment! 
This script I have developed for run MCEG on lx-plus using HT-Condor grid.
For Complex and time taking models i.e., POWHEG, EPOSLHC, SHERPA you can use HT-Condor grid computing.
